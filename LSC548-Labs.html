<button class="collapsible">Lab 1: Getting Started with Web Design</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
  <p>Lab 1 has three key tasks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use the Wayback Machine to compare three versions of a library's website and write up your findings.</li>
    <li>Create a basic HTML page.</li>
    <li>Use HTML styles to adjust the look of your web page, as well as adding supplementary images and a table to your comparison from Task 1.</li>
</ol>
  <p>Through the completion of these tasks, students will demonstrate achievement of the following learning objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare and contrast the aesthetic feel, navigation , and breadth of content in multiple versions of a web page.</li>
    <li>Create a basic HTML document.</li>
    <li>Create a styled HTML web page.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>NOTE: I strongly recommend completing this week's lesson before beginning the lab!</em>
  <h2>Task 1: Use the Wayback Machine</h2>
  <p>First, go to the <a href="https://web.archive.org" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>. This is a website sponsored by the Internet Archive (a nonprofit). It stores multiple versions of websites going back many years. All you have to do is paste a URL in the search box to retrieve the history of that page.</p>
  <p>For example, type uri.edu in the box and hit browse history and see what you get. When I did this in April 2022, I saw that this site had been saved 5,721 times between February 23, 1997 and April 3, 2022. You should get something similar but updated to November 2022. You can then click into any year and any of the saved versions for that year to view the page. Check out the first available version in January 2009. You can see URI has been using the same logo for more than 10 years, but the website used to be much darker than it is now because of the blue background that was in use in Jan. 2009 vs. the white background in use today. Those are two comparisons from 2009 to 2022: one a similarity and one a difference</p>
  <p>What you are going to do is pick a library website and view that website today, the first available version in 2017 (e.g., Jan. 1), and the first available version in 2012 (e.g., Jan. 1). Write one paragraph about the aesthetic feel, navigation options, and breadth of content in each iteration and a fourth paragraph comparing all 3 versions (4 paragraphs total). Include the link to each iteration in the paragraph about it. You also need a list of 3-5 key changes you see over time and a list of the 3 biggest/most important changes from most important to least. For Task 3, you will also need a table showing a timeline of the changes and screenshots to illustrate your points. Take the screenshots as you are working, along with sufficient notes to generate the timeline, and save everything where you can find it later.</p>
  <h2>Task 2: Create an HTML Document</h2>
  <p>The main focus of this semester is on helping you build a website. Let's get started! A web page is created using a markup language, most commonly Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML. That is what we are going to use (along with CSS and JavaScript, coming later). Use the HTML5 Tutorial available from W3Schools to start building your webpage; see the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank">HTML Introduction page</a> for the code for a "simple HTML document."</p>
  <p>Writing HTML code requires the use of a text editor. For now, use the text editor that came with your operating system: Notepad on PC and TextEdit on Mac. You can find instructions for getting started with each in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp" target="_blank">HTML Editors page</a> of the HTML5 Tutorial. <em>Make sure to read and follow the instructions regarding naming the file.</em> You should name this file index.html as suggested on the HTML5 Tutorial. As a matter of fact, there already <em>is</em> a file named index.html in your folder in the Shared LSC 548 Fall 2022 Website in Google Drive. So really, you can just open that file with your text editor and modify it.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp" target="_blank">HTML Basic page</a> in the tutorial contains enough information to build a simple HTML document that includes the following items:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The required code for an HTML page from the HTML5 Tutorial</li>
    <li>Your name coded in the most important HTML heading</li>
    <li>A header for this lab (Lab 1) coded in the second most important HTML heading</li>
    <li>Your four paragraphs comparing the website over time that you wrote as part of Task 1, including the links</li>
    <li>An unordered list of the 3-5 key changes you see over time</li>
    <li>An ordered list of the 3 biggest/most important changes from most important to least</li>
  </ul>
  <em>NOTE: While you are working on an HTML document, you can always open your index.html file in any browser to see how it looks. You can also make changes in your text editor, save them, then refresh the browser window to immediately see the effect of the changes you made in your code. I demonstrated this in the Lesson. I also mentioned in the lesson how important it is to be very careful with your typing and proofreading. There is no spellcheck in Notepad or TextEdit, so you have to manually check for typos in your text. And if you make errors in your code, the code won't work and your page won't render as expected. I like to go slowly, keep my file open in both a text editor and a browser and regularly save the .html file and refresh the browser to see if everything is working (or not) and check for typos.</em>

  <h2>Task 3: Editing Your Web Page Using HTML Styles</h2>
  <p>Use the HTML5 Tutorial available from W3Schools to continue building your webpage; see HTML Paragraphs, HTML Styles, HTML Colors, HTML Images, HTML Tables, and HTML Lists for specific instructions for the different aspects of this lab (but really you should read everything in the HTML5 Tutorial from HTML HOME to HTML Lists this week).</p>
  <p>Notepad and TextEdit are OK text editors, but they're not great when you start advancing beyond the basics. I recommend the use of Atom, available for free <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">here</a>. This is what I use so it's what you will see in the Lessons. It does some automatic fill of syntax, elements, attributes, etc. And it uses a little color coding to differentiate HTML elements, attributes, CSS properties (coming soon), etc.</p>
  <p>For this part of the lab, you need to modify your index.html file from Tasks 1 and 2. Do NOT rename the file. If you really want to save the old version from Tasks 1 and 2 as a separate file, save the old version as index_Tasks1&2.html and save this current version as index.html. You need it to be index.html to work as the home page of your site.</p>
  <p>Make the following changes to your web page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Change the color and font for your name (styled in the h1 tag).</li>
    <li>Rename the header from Lab 1 to Comparison of X Website (replace X with the Library's name) and style the h2 tag to match the color and font used for your name.</li>
    <li>Change the font of the four paragraphs comparing the website over time that you wrote as part of Task 1.</li>
    <li>Speaking of those 4 paragraphs, leave the colors alone but set the target attribute for your links to open in a new window or tab.</li>
    <li>Now add the screenshots you took that illustrate points you are making in these paragraphs.</li>
    <li>Change the bullets in the unordered list of the 3-5 key changes you see over time. Choose any option other than disc since that is the default.</li>
    <li>Change the list type for the ordered list of the 3 biggest/most important changes from most important to least. Choose anything other than type 1 since that is the default.</li>
    <li>Add the timeline mentioned earlier as a table here. Your table should have 4 columns and 4 rows. The first column header should be Year, the next column header should be Aesthetic Feel, followed by Navigation Options, followed by Content. The second row will be 2012, the third row will be 2017, and the fourth row will be 2022. Fill in the remaining cells based on your own analysis from this lab. Add a border to your table.</li>
    <li>Finally, add another paragraph (styled to match all other paragraphs) reflecting on what you learned in Lab 1.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>REMINDER: While you are working, you can always open your index.html file in any browser to see how it looks. You can also make changes in your text editor, save them, then refresh the browser window to immediately see the effect of the changes you made in your code. I will mention again how important it is to be very careful with your typing and proofreading. Manually check for typos in your text and errors in your code to ensure the code works and your page renders as expected. I like to go slowly, keep my file open in both a text editor and a browser and regularly save the .html file and refresh the browser to see if everything is working (or not) and check for typos.</em>
  <h2>Sumitting Your Lab Work</h2>
  <p>All lab work in this class is submitted in your folder in the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LJvUwRAKAAydNrMDoQ3GnXxsDy7VeIHe?usp=sharing" target="_blank">LSC 548 Fall 2022 Website</a> shared folder in Google Drive. Open Google Drive, navigate to the LSC 548 Fall 2022 Website folder, and navigate to the folder with your last name. In that folder, upload your index.html file to replace the placeholder one I created for you, <em>and</em> upload all image files. You need to be 100% sure that the image filenames match how you typed them into your HTML code - and yes, this is case sensitive. See Lesson for visual instructions. Once you've done this, your page should be live and visible to anyone who has access to the LSC 548 Fall 2022 Website shared folder in Google Drive (your instructor and classmates). Check it out by going to the Student Pages section of the LSC 548 webpage and clicking on your name. If you uploaded your index.html file in the correct folder and matched all the filenames for uploaded images, you should see it working. You don't have to do anything else to submit your Lab 1 assignment.</p>

<!-- Lab 2 instructions -->
<button class="collapsible">Lab 2: Usability Testing</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
  <p>You read about usability testing in the textbook. Now you are going to run your own usability test. This lab has three key tasks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Design and run a usability test.</li>
    <li>Style your web page using internal CSS.</li>
    <li>Report results via your web page.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Through the completion of these tasks, students will demonstrate achievement of the following learning objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conduct a usability test.</li>
    <li>Analyze and report results of a usability test.</li>
    <li>Create a styled HTML web page using internal CSS.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>NOTE: I strongly recommend recruiting your 5 participants ASAP!</em>
  <h2>Task 1: Design and Run a Usability Test</h2>
  <p>For this task, you will need to design and implement a usability test of the current version of the website used in Lab 1. You are required to get 5 users to participate in your usability test.</p>
  <p>I recommend  recruiting your 5 participants right away so you know you have 5 and can schedule the tests with them. Your 5 participants could be classmates, friends, co-workers, family, etc.</p>
  <p>Next, you will design the usability test protocol. Start by brainstorming 8-10 tasks users are likely to need to complete on this website. Try the tasks on the website and settle on 4 tasks to use for you usability test. Determine what the standard of success is for each task (e.g., time to completion, clicks, satisfaction, combination of factors, etc.). Prepare a script to use during the test.</p>
  <p>Next you will run the usability test, taking observational notes as you go. Remember you also need to track the success rates for each participant for each task.</p>
  <p>Now, you will analyze the results of your usability test, looking at your standards for success and overall impressions from the test results.</p>
  <p>For the next task, you are going to need at least one table and one chart (like a bar chart or pie chart) to accompany your results, so think about those while you are conducting the analysis.</p>
  <h2>Task 2: Style Your Web Page Using Internal CSS</h2>
  <p>So far, you have styled your web page using inline styles. As you add more content to your page, it can get tedious to have to style every paragraph, every header, every table, etc. This is the benefit of CSS.</p>
  <p>Right now, you only have the one page so it makes sense to style that using internal CSS via the style element (in the head element) of your HTML code. This topic is covered in the HTML5 Tutorial under <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp" target="_blank">HTML CSS</a>, which you should have already read.</p>
  <p>Based on what you've done so far on your web page, you have styled paragraphs, headers, ordered and unordered lists, and a table. Rather than continuing to use inline styles for each element, convert <b>all</b> of your styling code into internal CSS via the style element in the head element, following the instructions in the Tutorial.</p>
  <p>Your style element should contain CSS style properties for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>paragraphs,</li>
    <li>h1 and h2 headings,</li>
    <li>ordered and unordered lists, and</li>
    <li>tables</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Task 3: Report Results Via Your Web Page</h2>
  <p>You will report your results on your web page. Modify your index.html file from Lab 1. Do NOT rename the file. If you really want to save the old version from Lab 2 as a separate file, save the old version as index_Lab1.html and save this current version as index.html. You need it to be index.html to work as the home page of your site.</p>
  <p>You will need to add the following to your web page to fulfill the requirements of this lab:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A new header for this lab, to go under everything you did for Comparison of X Website. The new header should be Usability Test of X Website (replace X with the Library's name) and use the h2 tag.</li>
    <li>An introductory paragraph that explains your test protocol, brainstorming process, and participants (<b>don't</b> give their names or any identifying information, just general demographics).</li>
    <li>Report of results in narrative form with at least one table and one chart (add as an img).</li>
    <li>A paragraph that reports your conclusions about the usability of the website.</li>
    <li>A final paragraph reflecting on what you learned in Lab 2.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You already know how to upload your .html file from Lab 1. You will have to re-upload it (overwrite the original file) with your revised index.html file to share your work. You also need to upload <em>in the same folder</em> the image you are using as your chart. Make sure you used the correct file name for the image in your code and that everything displays as excpected when you access the link for your web page from the course website, Student Pages. Once you see it working in the live website, you're all set. You don't have to do anything else to submit your Lab 2 assignment.</p>

<!-- Lab 3 instructions -->
<button class="collapsible">Lab 3: Chunking Content and Using External CSS</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
  <p>Lab 3 has three key tasks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Separate your website into multiple pages.</li>
    <li>Create a navigation menu using links.</li>
    <li>Style those pages using an external stylesheet.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Through the completion of these tasks, students will demonstrate achievement of the following learning objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Build a multi-page website.</li>
    <li>Create a working navigation menu.</li>
    <li>Style a website using external CSS.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>NOTE: I strongly recommend completing this week's lesson before beginning the lab!</em>
  <h2>Task 1: Chunking Your Content</h2>
  <p>The first step is to chunk your content into separate pages. For now, you need three pages:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>index.html: your home page</li>
    <li>comparison.html: For your comparison essay from Lab 1</li>
    <li>usability.html: For your usability test from Lab 2</li>
  </ol>
  <p>There is no need to retype anything. See the Lesson for a demonstration, but you can set up the new pages in Atom, keep all three files open at once, and copy & paste from index.html to the other two new pages. Then you just delete out the parts of the code that no longer belong on each page. This means you really won't have any content left on index.html so add a paragraph or two about yourself, along with a photo of yourself or something that represents you. This will be the new content of your index page. The content of your comparison page is everything from the Comparison of X Website header until the Usability Test of X Website header. Then the usability page is everything from the Usability Test of X Website header down to the bottom.</p>
  <h2>Task 2: Creating a Basic Navigation Menu</h2>
  <p>You need to help your user navigate among your three pages. For now, let's do this via links at the bottom of the page. So, on your index page, add links for your comparison and usability pages. Since you are going to upload everything in the same folder, you should be able to do this using comparison.html and usability.html as the URLs.</p>
  <p>Now go to your comparison page and add links at the bottom for your home page (index) and your usability page. Then go to your usability page and add links for your home page (index) and your comparison page. Save the files and refresh your browser to make sure everything is working properly.</p>
  <p>Unless you deleted out the coding in your style element in the head element, your pages should still have all the same styling as each other, which you can view by saving your three pages and opening them each in your browser window. But, what happens when you start creating new pages? Do you really want to have to copy/paste the style element to each new page, and then when you add a new style element to a new page, you'll have to go back and update it on every other page. There is an easier way...</p>
  <h2>Task 3: Styling Multiple Web Pages with One External CSS Stylesheet</h2>
  <p>Use the HTML5 and CSS Tutorials available from W3Schools to continue building your webpage; see HTML CSS and CSS Introduction, CSS Syntax, CSS How To (see External Style Sheet), CSS Colors, CSS Borders, CSS Text, CSS Fonts, CSS Links, CSS Lists, and CSS Tables for specific instructions for the different aspects of this lab (but really you should read everything in the CSS Tutorial from CSS HOME to CSS Tables this week).</p>
  <p>As you read in the CSS Tutorial, you can create one stylesheet, then link to that stylesheet in the head tag of innumerable HTML pages, and style them all the same just by making the changes in one place (your stylesheet). When you make an update to the stylesheet, it automatically updates on every page that links to that stylesheet. So, now that you have a three-page website, it's time to set up your stylesheet.</p>
  <p>External CSS stylesheets are text files that end with the extension .css. You can create them in any text editor, and since we are using Atom, you can create it there. Start a new document in Atom, and save is at stylesheet.css. Make sure you save it in the same folder where all your .html files are so your computer can find everything properly when you are viewing your pages offline via a local browser.</p>
  <p>You've already done a lot of the work of creating what goes in your external stylesheet. That code is currently in the style element of the head element of your three pages. Copy it from your index page and paste it in your CSS document. Read through it carefully to make sure everything is how you want it and follows CSS syntax. Then edit your three pages to remove the style element and replace it with a link in the head that links to your stylesheet. Save everything, then refresh your pages in your browser and make sure everything looks right.</p>
  <p>If you want to add comments to help identify the different elements being styled in different parts of the code in your CSS file, go ahead and do that as well.</p>
  <p>Ok, now you need to share all of your website with the class through the shared folder on Google Drive. You already know how to do this from the previous 2 labs. It's just that now you have to make sure all three html files, your css file, and all your image files are uploaded in the folder with your name in the shared Google Drive folder.</p>
  <p>Once you've done this, your website should be live. Check it out using the link for your web page from the course website, Student Pages. Once you see it working in the live website, you're all set. You don't have to do anything else to submit your Lab 3 assignment.</p>

<!-- Lab 4 instructions -->
<button class="collapsible">Lab 4: Treemapping and Navigation Menus with CSS</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
  <p>Lab 4 has three key tasks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Collect data from your library website and use that data to produce a treemap that you present on your web page.</li>
    <li>Create a navigation bar (navbar) and deploy that navbar across all pages in a website.</li>
    <li>Present your navbar on your website on the class website.</li>  </ol>
  <p>Through the completion of these tasks, students will demonstrate achievement of the following learning objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand and visualize the organization of a website.</li>
    <li>Use CSS to develop an aesthetically pleasing navigation menu.</li>
    <li>Deploy a uniform navbar across all pages of a multi-page website.</li>
    </ul>
  <em>NOTE: I strongly recommend completing Ding et al. (2017) Chapter 5, the CSS tutorials in W3Schools, especially CSS Navigation Bar and CSS Selectors, and this week's lesson before beginning the lab!</em>
  <h2>Task 1: Creating a Treemap</h2>
  <p>The first step is make a list of all the pages in the website. You already took LSC 508 so you have some familiarity with both Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. Depending on which of those products you prefer, choose one of them to create a new spreadsheet you can use to collect the data on all the pages in your website. In order to create a treemap from this data, you are going to need the following columns (you can use different terms but you need this general information):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Top Level Content (parent)</li>
    <li>Second Level Content (object under parent)</li>
    <li>Third Level Content (object under that, if there are any)</li>
    <li>Fourth Level Content (object under that, if there are any)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The specificity here depends on the content and structure of the website you are using. For example, top level content is probably on the navigation menu on the website and might be terms like About, Contact, Collections, Events, etc. Then you have to go to <strong>each</strong> page in the website to get the title of the page and figure out where it belongs in the organizational structure of the website. Those are the level 2-4 (or more) content.</p>
  <p>This task is probably going to take you several hours to complete. Be thorough!</p>
  <p>Next, use Sheets or Excel to produce a treemap from your data. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-treemap-chart-in-office-dfe86d28-a610-4ef5-9b30-362d5c624b68" target="_blank">Here</a> are instructions for creating a treemap in Excel. <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9146947?hl=en" target="_blank">Here</a> are instructions for creating a treemap in Sheets.</p>
  <p>Make sure you are happy with how your treemap looks when you're done. You can adjust the colors in both Excel and Sheets, and you may have to adjust your data if your treemap doesn't look right. When you are done and satisfied with your treemap, take a screenshot of it (and please crop your image so we just see the treemap and not extra cells in the background).</p>
  <p>Ok, now you need to add your treemap to your website. Of course this requires a few steps, as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a new file in Atom for treemap.html and make sure this page has links to all of your other pages (you just did this last week, so refer back to Lab 3 if you need help). The easiest way to do this is to copy the code from one of your other pages and adjust as needed. That way, you already have all the necessary head code, the link to your stylesheet, etc.</li>
    <li>Add a link on all your existing pages for this new page. Save all the files and refresh your browser to make sure everything is working properly.</li>
    <li>Add a header for your new page, Treemap of X Website (replace X with the Library's name) and use the h2 tag (to match your other pages).</li>
    <li>Add 1-2 paragraphs explaining how you created your treemap. We don't need a step-by-step tutorial since we can all follow the links for the tutorials on using Excel and Sheets, but we do want to know the process you used to collect the data and ascribe levels to the content you found on the website.</li>
    <li>Add the image of your treemap. Do not forget an alt tag.</li>
    <li>Add 1-2 paragraphs of reflection on what you learned by producing this tree map.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Task 2: Create a Navigation Bar</h2>
  <p>At this point, your website has a homepage (your index.html file), your comparison page, usability test results page, and treemap page. So far, you've been linking to them through plain links at the bottom of each page. This week, you are going to create a navigation menu that will help the user navigate your multi-page website.</p>
  <p>There are lots of ways to create a navigation menu. You are going to do it using CSS. Start by refreshing yourself on the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" target="_blank">CSS Navigation Bar tutorial</a>. For this lab, you can choose to do a vertical navigation bar or a horizontal navigation bar. I did a horizontal navigation bar across the top of the pages on the class website, but there is also a vertical navigation bar example on the Student Websites page. In the lesson, I demonstrate a basic vertical navbar.</p>
  <p>You need to include in your navigation bar ALL of the pages on your site. This means that on your index.html page your navbar should include links for the Homepage (your index.html page), as well as all of your other pages. Use the Navigation Bar = List of Links example on the CSS Navigation Bars tutorial page to get you started. I recommend placing the code for the navbar as the first element inside the body tag on your index.html page.</p>
  <p>Some things to note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The CSS to remove the bullets, margins, and padding goes in your stylesheet.css file.</li>
    <li>You should try out the instructions to format a Vertical Navigation Bar or Horizontal Navigation Bar (or try both and see which you like better).</li>
    <li>This is definitely an activity where you'll want to have your index.html file open in Atom while you're working and you'll want it open in your browser so you can keep refreshing to see how things are looking.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you have the navbar that you want to implement across your entire site, you are ready to move on. Don't forget to keep checking how things look in your browser window as you work.</p>
  <h2>Task 3: Implement the Navbar Across Your Entire Website</h2>
  <p>You have a navbar! But it needs to be on all of your pages and it needs to look and operate correctly on each page. Since your CSS to style your navbar is in your stylesheet.css file, the styling will appear the same on every page in your website.</p>
  <p>So what you need to so is place the HTML code for the navbar (the list of links) in the same place in your HTML code on each page. If you put it as the first element inside the body tag on your index.html page, then you also need to put it in that same place on every other page. Don't worry, you can copy and paste it. And remember, you can have all your pages open in Atom at once to make this even easier. If you chose a navbar example with active/current navigation link to be highlighted, then for each page in your site, you have to adjust the HTML code accordingly to mark which item in the list gets the active class in addition to the navbar class (do this using class="navbar active").</p>
  <p>Save all of your HTML files and your stylsheet.css file, refresh your browser, and check that the navbar looks right and links correctly on each page.</p>

  <p>Ok, now you need to share all of your website with the class through the shared folder on Google Drive. You already know how to do this from the previous 3 labs. It's just that now you have to make sure all four html files, your css file, and all your image files are uploaded in the folder with your name in the shared Google Drive folder.</p>
  <p>Once you've done this, your website should be live. Check it out using the link for your web page from the course website, Student Pages. Once you see it working in the live website, you're all set. You don't have to do anything else to submit your Lab 4 assignment.</p>

<button class="collapsible">Lab 5: Designing Website Layout with CSS</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
  <p>Lab 5 has three key tasks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select an appropriate layout for a website.</li>
    <li>Deploy that layout across all pages in a website.</li>
    <li>Present your newly laid out website on the class website.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Through the completion of these tasks, students will demonstrate achievement of the following learning objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use CSS to develop an aesthetically pleasing website layout.</li>
    <li>Deploy a uniform layout across all pages of a multi-page website.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>NOTE: I strongly recommend completing the CSS tutorials in W3Schools, especially CSS Website Layout, reading Ding et al. (2017) Chapters 5-8, and this week's lesson before beginning the lab!</em>
  <h2>Task 1: Choose a Layout</h2>
  <p>You have multiple pages on your website and a good design approach to help the user find things on every page is to delpoy a uniform layout across the pages. So to do this, you first have to consider the content of each page and how it would be best laid out for the viewer. Start there.</p>
  <p>Then review the different layout options in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp" target="_blank">CSS Website Layout tutorial</a>. There are some other options in the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_templates.asp" target="_blank">CSS Templates</a>, or lots of others are available freely on the Web. Choose the layout that best fits the content of the pages on your website.</p>
  <em>Most likely, you are going to be changing your navbar to fit with the layout you selected. The layouts in the templates use a lot of div tags, and they put the navbar in a div. That's OK (it's actually how the navbar is coded on the class website).</em>
  <p>Once you have the layout that you want to implement across your entire site, you are ready to move on.</p>
  <h2>Task 2: Implement the Layout Across Your Entire Website</h2>
  <p>The CSS code to style your layout goes in your stylesheet.css file so that the styling of the layout appears the same on every page in your website. If you added a header or footer, make sure to put some content in those tags on each page of your website. If the template you chose also sets a style for content (which it probably does), you'll also need to adjust your code on each page to add a div with class content for this.</p>
  <p>Save your stylesheet.css file and any changes you made to your HTML files, and refresh your browser to check the layout appears correctly on all pages of your website.</p>
  <h2>Task 3: Present Your New Layout on Your Website</h2>
  <p>Now you need to share all of your website with the class through the shared folder on Google Drive. You already know how to do this from the previous 4 labs.</p>
  <p>Once you've done this, your website should be live. Check it out using the link for your web page from the course website, Student Pages. Once you see it working in the live website, you're all set. You don't have to do anything else to submit your Lab 5 assignment.</p>

<!-- Lab 6 instructions -->
<button class="collapsible">Lab 6: Getting Started with Programming</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
  <p>Lab 6 has three key tasks:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Add two JavaScript events using a button and mouseover.</li>
    <li>Complete the Intro to App Lab on Code.org and build an app.</li>
    <li>Present your new pages with functioning JavaScript and the link to your App on the class website.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Through the completion of these tasks, students will demonstrate achievement of the following learning objectives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use JavaScript to create an onclick event.</li>
    <li>Use JavaScript to create an onmouseover event.</li>
    <li>Create a basic web app.</li>

  </ul>
  <em>NOTE: I strongly recommend completing the JavaScript tutorials in W3Schools, especially JS HOME through JS Events and this week's lesson before beginning the lab and completing the Code.org Intro to App Lab lesson videos while doing the lab!</em>
  <h2>Task 1: Create JavaScript Events</h2>
  <p>First, you are going to create a button on your homepage that a user can click to determine whose page this is. The button will need to ask Whose page is this? And when a user clicks the button, your page needs to return your full name (first and last with a space between them).</p>
  <p>To accomplish this, you will need to do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an object variable Person that has both firstName and lastName values.</li>
    <li>Write a JavaScript function to call the variable Person (with a space between your first and last names).</li>
    <li>Create a button that display Whose page is this? and when the user clicks it the function to call the variable Person is executed.</li>
    <li>Add text above the button on your page with instructions for what the user should do (AKA make them click the button).</li>
    <li>Add text below the button to display your name when the button is clicked and the function is called.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>This task requires adding several lines of code: a p tag for the instructions, a button tag for the button, a script tag for the JavaScript, and a p tag to return your name when the function is called.</em>
  <p>Now you are going to change your Comparison of X Website page so that when a user drags their mouse over your header, the header changes from the color you chose to red.</p>
  <p>To accomplish this, you will need to do the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add onmouseover script within the h2 tag that is the header of this page.</li>
    <li>Make sure you are changing the text color (not the background color) to red.</li>
  </ul>
  <em>This task requires adding script within existing code on your page.</em>

  <h2>Task 2:  Intro to App Lab</h2>
  <p>Go to <a href="https://studio.code.org/s/applab-intro" target="_blank">Intro to App Lab</a>. You have to create an account so that you can share your app when it's complete.</p>
  <p>Complete steps 1-9 in Intro to App Lab. Watch the videos as you move along to help you with the tasks.</p>
  <p>Now, build an app by completing steps 10-15 in Intro to App Lab. Watch the videos as you move along to help you with the tasks. You can build any app you want.</p>
  <p>When you're done with your app, go to share it and get the link. Add this link to your homepage.</p>
  <em>I do recommend you try the link to make sure it's working so you know I and your peers will be able to view it. A great way to ensure it's working is to try pasting the link into a <b>different</b> browser from the one in which you completed Intro to App Lab.</em>

  <h2>Task 3: Share your website</h2>

  <p>Now you need to share all of your website with the class through the shared folder on Google Drive. You already know how to do this from the previous 5 labs.</p>
  <p>Once you've done this, your website should be live. Check it out using the link for your web page from the course website, Student Pages. Once you see it working in the live website, you're all set. You don't have to do anything else to submit your Lab 6 assignment.</p>
